# Getting started

## Setting up the development environment

Start by setting up NVM to manage node versions easily. Follow the installation [instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Run `nvm use` (you might need to install our specific Node.js version)

Once you are on the right node version, proceed with the following commands:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run ios` to run on iOS or `npm run android` to run on Android
